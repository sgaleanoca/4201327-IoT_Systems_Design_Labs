## Why Standards Matter in IoT

**Scenario**: You build an IoT system for a client.

**Without standards:**
- Client: "Where does authentication happen?"
- You: "Uh... in the code somewhere?"
- Client: "How do I integrate this with my existing infrastructure?"
- You: "Let me rebuild it to fit your needs..." 💸💸💸

**With standards:**
- Client: "Where does authentication happen?"
- You: "In the RAID (Resource Access & Interchange Domain), as defined in the Functional Viewpoint of ISO/IEC 30141."
- Client: "Perfect, that matches our architecture. Ship it!" ✅

**Standards provide a common language** for architects, clients, and stakeholders.

## ISO/IEC 30141:2024 Overview

### What is ISO/IEC 30141?

**Full title**: *Internet of Things (IoT) — Reference Architecture*

**Published**: 2024 (revised from 2018 edition)
**Scope**: Describes architecture for IoT systems from multiple viewpoints
**Goal**: Common framework for designing, implementing, and documenting IoT systems

**Think of it as**: The architectural blueprint language for IoT, like UML is for software or architectural drawings are for buildings.

### Six Viewpoints (ISO/IEC 30141 Section 6)

The standard describes IoT systems from **six complementary viewpoints**:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  ISO/IEC 30141 VIEWPOINTS                  │

│     - Concepts, definitions, characteristics              │
│                                                            │
│  2. BUSINESS          Why build this system?              │
│     - Value proposition, stakeholders, objectives         │
│                                                            │
│  3. USAGE             Who uses it and how?                │
│     - User roles, activities, interactions                │
│                                                            │
│  4. FUNCTIONAL        What does the system do?            │
│     - Functional components, data flows, domains          │
│                                                            │
│  5. TRUSTWORTHINESS   How do we ensure reliability?       │
│     - Security, privacy, safety, resilience               │
│                                                            │
│  6. CONSTRUCTION      How do we build and deploy it?      │
│     - Implementation patterns, deployment models          │
│                                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: Each viewpoint answers a different question. A complete architecture addresses **all six**.

### Why Six Viewpoints?

**Example**: Smart Agriculture System

**Viewpoint 1 - Foundational:**
- What is the system? A network of soil moisture sensors, irrigation actuators, and a control dashboard.

**Viewpoint 2 - Business:**
- Why? To reduce water usage by 30% while maintaining crop yield.
- Stakeholders: Farmers, agronomists, water utility companies.

**Viewpoint 3 - Usage:**
- Who? Farm manager (operator), agronomist (analyst), IT admin (administrator).
- How? Manager views dashboard, receives alerts, manually overrides automation.

**Viewpoint 4 - Functional:**
- Components: Sensors (SCD), irrigation controller (SCD), data analytics (ASD), dashboard (UD).
- Data flows: Sensor → Controller → Database → Dashboard.

**Viewpoint 5 - Trustworthiness:**
- Security: Encrypted communication (DTLS), authenticated OTA updates.
- Reliability: Mesh self-healing, redundant Border Routers.
- Safety: Fail-safe irrigation shutoff on sensor malfunction.

**Viewpoint 6 - Construction:**
- Implementation: ESP32-C6 devices, Thread mesh, CoAP protocol, Docker-based backend.
- Deployment: On-premises Border Router, cloud-hosted dashboard.

**Each viewpoint reveals different aspects.** Together, they form a complete picture.

## 3. Viewpoints vs. Domains: An Important Distinction

Before we dive into the domain details, let's clear up a common confusion.

**Viewpoints** and **domains** are different things in ISO/IEC 30141:

- **Six Viewpoints** (Section 6) are *lenses* — they answer different questions about the same system (What is it? Why build it? Who uses it? What does it do? Is it trustworthy? How is it built?). We covered them in Section 2 above.
- **Six Functional Domains** (PED, SCD, ASD, OMD, UD, RAID) are categories within the **Functional Viewpoint** specifically. They describe *where different functions live* in an IoT system.

Think of it this way: if the viewpoints are different camera angles on a building, the domains are the floor plan visible from the Functional angle.

**Why this matters**: When Samuel asks "Which domain does this belong to?" he's asking about functional classification. When he asks "Analyze this from the Trustworthiness viewpoint," he's asking you to apply a different lens — one that cuts *across* all domains (security, reliability, and safety apply everywhere, not just in one box).

Throughout this course, we use the domains as a practical tool for organizing components and data flows. But your DDR should address multiple viewpoints, not just domain mapping.

## 4. The Six Functional Domains

The **Functional Viewpoint** (Viewpoint 4) organizes IoT system functions into **six domains**. Each domain groups related capabilities.

### Domain Details

#### PED - Physical Entity Domain

**Definition**: Physical objects that are sensed or controlled by the IoT system.

**Key Entities**:
- **Sensed physical objects**: Things you measure (temperature, humidity, motion)
- **Controlled physical objects**: Things you control (motors, lights, valves)

**Examples**:
- Smart home: Room temperature (sensed), thermostat setpoint (controlled)
- Agriculture: Soil moisture (sensed), irrigation pump (controlled)
- Industry: Machine vibration (sensed), conveyor belt speed (controlled)

**Important**: PED is NOT part of the IoT system—it's the **environment** the system operates in.

---

#### SCD - Sensing & Controlling Domain

**Definition**: Devices that interface with the physical world. The "edge" of the IoT system.

**Key Components**:
- **Sensors**: Acquire information from physical entities
- **Actuators**: Change properties of physical entities
- **IoT Gateways**: Connect SCD to other domains (protocol conversion, data aggregation)
- **Local control systems**: Run control loops without cloud connectivity

**Functions** (ISO/IEC 30141 Section 6.4-6.5):
- Sensing and actuation
- Protocol conversion (e.g., Thread → WiFi)
- Address mapping (e.g., MAC → IPv6)
- Data processing (e.g., filtering, aggregation)
- Security enforcement (e.g., firewall at gateway)

**In Our Course**:
- ESP32-C6 devices: Sensors, actuators
- Thread Border Router: IoT gateway
- Labs 1-2, 5: Focus on SCD

**Example**: ESP32-C6 reads temperature sensor (ADC) → Formats as CoAP message → Sends via Thread mesh → Border Router converts to WiFi → Forwards to cloud.

---

#### ASD - Application & Service Domain

**Definition**: Core functions and services that deliver IoT system functionality to users.

**Key Components**:
- **Basic services**: Data access, storage, processing, fusion
- **Business services**: Application-specific logic (e.g., irrigation scheduler)
- **Application hosting**: Platform for running IoT applications

**Functions**:
- Data storage (databases, time-series storage)
- Data processing (filtering, aggregation, analytics)
- Business logic (rules engine, decision making)
- Application APIs (REST, GraphQL, CoAP)

**In Our Course**:
- CoAP server: Application-layer protocol
- Data processing: JSON/CBOR parsing, validation
- Dashboard backend: Business logic
- Labs 3-4, 7: Focus on ASD

**Example**: CoAP server receives sensor data → Stores in time-series database → Runs analytics (detect anomalies) → Triggers alert if threshold exceeded.

---

#### OMD - Operation & Management Domain

**Definition**: Components responsible for managing devices and system operation.

**Key Components**:
- **OSS (Operational Support System)**:
  - Device lifecycle management (provisioning, decommissioning)
  - Monitoring and alerting
  - Compliance checking
  - Firmware updates (OTA)

- **BSS (Business Support System)** (if applicable):
  - Customer relationship management (CRM)
  - Subscription management
  - Billing and payment

**In Our Course**:
- OTA updates: OSS function (device lifecycle)
- Monitoring: Dashboard showing device health
- Labs 6-8: Focus on OMD

**Example**: OTA service detects new firmware version → Schedules update during low-traffic hours → Downloads to device → Verifies signature → Reboots → Confirms successful boot → Logs event.

---

#### UD - User Domain

**Definition**: Human and digital users interacting with the IoT system.

**Key Components**:
- **Human users**: People with specific roles (admin, operator, viewer)
- **Digital users**: Other systems/devices accessing IoT capabilities
- **HMI subsystem**: User interface (web, mobile, voice)

**User Roles** (vary by system):
| Role | Permissions | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Administrator | Full control, configuration | IT staff |
| Operator | Monitoring, limited control | Factory supervisor |
| Viewer | Read-only access | Data analyst |
| Digital User | API access (OAuth) | External system integration |

**In Our Course**:
- Web dashboard: HMI for human users
- REST API: Interface for digital users
- Labs 7-8: Focus on UD

**Example**: Farm manager (human user) logs into dashboard → Views sensor readings → Clicks "Irrigate Zone 3" → UD sends command to ASD → ASD forwards to SCD → Actuator activates pump.

---

#### RAID - Resource Access & Interchange Domain

**Definition**: Controls access to IoT system resources and exposes capabilities to external systems.

**Key Components**:
- **Access management**: Authentication (who are you?), authorization (what can you do?)
- **Interchange subsystem**: Expose APIs, data, services to external parties
- **Reverse access management**: IoT system accessing partner systems

**Functions**:
- User/device authentication (certificates, OAuth, API keys)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API gateway (rate limiting, throttling)
- API documentation (OpenAPI, Swagger)

**In Our Course**:
- CoAP authentication: Access management
- Resource discovery (/.well-known/core): API exposure
- Labs 4, 6, 8: RAID aspects

**Example**: External analytics platform requests data → RAID authenticates API key → Checks authorization (does this key have read access?) → If yes, forward to ASD → Return data → Log access.

---

### Domain Interaction Example

**Scenario**: User wants to turn on a pump remotely.

```
1. UD: User clicks "Turn On Pump" in dashboard
2. RAID: Authenticate user, check authorization (is user allowed?)
3. ASD: Business logic validates (is it safe to turn on pump? Not already on?)
4. SCD: Send CoAP PUT to actuator device
5. PED: Actuator turns on physical pump
6. SCD: Send confirmation back to ASD
7. ASD: Update database (pump state = ON)
8. UD: Dashboard updates button (Pump: ON ✅)
9. OMD: Log event (User X turned on Pump Y at Time Z)

Data flows through all six domains in ~200-500 ms.
```

```

### Progressive Learning: From Components to Systems

**Lab 1-2**: IoT **Component** (single device)
- One ESP32-C6 device
- Understands: SCD basics

**Lab 3-5**: IoT **System** (multiple interacting components)
- Multiple Thread devices + Border Router
- Understands: SCD, ASD, RAID interactions

**Lab 6-8**: IoT **Environment** (complete operational system)
- Full stack: Sensors → Mesh → Gateway → Backend → Dashboard
- Understands: All six domains, all six viewpoints

**ISO/IEC 30141 Hierarchy** (Section 6.2.2.2):
```
IoT Component → IoT System → IoT Environment
 (Lab 1-2)       (Lab 3-5)       (Lab 6-8)
```

**Viewpoint Progression**:
```
Foundational + Usage    → Business + Functional  → Trustworthiness + Construction
 (Lab 1-2: "what is     (Lab 3-5: "what does     (Lab 6-8: "is it secure?
  this device?")          the system do?")          how do we build it?")
```

## 6. Emergent Characteristics
### What Makes IoT Systems Special?

ISO/IEC 30141 Section 6.2.2.3 defines **emergent characteristics** — properties that arise from the system as a whole, not individual components.

| Characteristic | Definition | Course Example |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Composability** | Components combine into larger systems | ESP32-C6 + Border Router + Dashboard = Complete system |
| **Functional/Management Separation** | Data plane and control plane are independent | CoAP sensor data vs. Thread leader election — you can change one without touching the other |
| **Heterogeneity** | Diverse devices, protocols, data formats | Thread + WiFi, CoAP + HTTP, CBOR + JSON |
| **Highly distributed** | Sub-systems are physically separated and remotely located | Sensor nodes in a field, border router at the farmhouse, dashboard in the cloud |
| **Modularity** | Independent modules with defined interfaces | Each CoAP resource is independent |
| **Network communication** | Distributed components communicate via multiple network types | Proximity (802.15.4), Access (CoAP), Service (cloud), User (dashboard) |
| **Scalability** | System grows without architectural change | Add more Thread devices without reconfiguring |
| **Shareability** | Resources shared among multiple users | Multiple dashboard users access same sensors |
| **Accuracy** | Data quality and measurement reliability | Sensor calibration, error detection, environmental influence on readings |

### Example: Scalability

**Non-scalable design** (star topology):
```
All devices connect to central hub.
Add 100th device → Hub overloaded → System breaks.
```

**Scalable design** (mesh topology):
```
Devices form mesh with distributed routing.
Add 100th device → Mesh grows, no single bottleneck.
(Thread supports up to 511 devices per network)
```

**Thread is inherently scalable** due to mesh architecture.

### Example: Autonomy

**Non-autonomous**:
```
Router fails → Network down → Human must manually reconfigure all devices.
```

**Autonomous** (Thread):
```
Router fails → Mesh detects failure (30s) → Self-heals (re-routes) → No human intervention needed.
```

**ISO/IEC 30141 emphasizes systems that manage themselves.**

## 7. Q&A and Course Expectations
### Course Deliverables

1. **DDR (Decision & Design Record)**: Living document tracking your architectural decisions
   - Maps each lab to ISO/IEC 30141 domains
   - Documents design choices (ADRs)
   - Records performance measurements
   - See [3_deliverables_template.md](3_deliverables_template.md)

2. **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**: Integrated into DDR template
   - Example: "Why CoAP instead of MQTT?"
   - See ADR section in deliverables template

3. **Lab Implementations**: Working code for each lab
   - Must meet performance baselines (see [references.md](references.md) for performance targets)

4. **Final Integration** (Lab 8): Complete system demonstrating all six domains

### Assessment Rubric (High-Level)

| Component | Weight | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Lab Implementations** | 50% | Does it work? Meets performance targets? |
| **DDR Quality** | 30% | Architectural thinking, ISO mapping, ADRs |
| **Final Integration** | 15% | End-to-end system, failure mode analysis |
| **Participation** | 5% | Engagement, helping peers |

**Key**: We assess **architectural understanding**, not just coding ability.

### Study Resources

- **ISO/IEC 30141:2024 Standard**: [ISO_IEC_30141_2024(en).pdf](../ISO_IEC_30141_2024(en).pdf) (focus on Section 5 for context, Section 6 for viewpoints and views, Annex A for construction patterns)
- **Quick References**: [references.md](references.md) — CoAP, Thread, ESP-IDF cheat sheets and performance baselines
- **Project Scenario**: [1_project_scenario.md](1_project_scenario.md) — GreenField Technologies context
- **Lab Guides**: [labs/](labs/) — 8 role-based lab guides with integrated theory

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to memorize all six domains?**
A: No, but you should understand what each domain does and be able to map your work to the correct domain(s).

**Q: Will we use all six domains in every lab?**
A: No. Labs 1-2 focus mainly on SCD. Later labs progressively add more domains. Lab 8 covers all six.

**Q: Is this course more theory or practical?**
A: **Both**. You'll build working systems (practical) while understanding **why** they work (theory). The theory preambles (10-15 min each lab) explain first principles.

**Q: What if I'm not familiar with networking concepts?**
A: That's okay! We start with basics (IEEE 802.15.4) and progressively build up. Review [references.md](references.md) if you need a refresher.

**Q: How much time should I expect to spend per lab?**
A: ~6-8 hours per lab (2-3 hours in class, 4-5 hours outside). Labs 6-8 may take longer (10-12 hours).

## Homework Assignment (Due Next Week)

### Part 1: Read ISO/IEC 30141 Excerpts
- Section 6.2: Foundational IoT viewpoint (IoT concepts, components, systems, environments)
- Section 6.4: Usage viewpoint (sensing, actuating, user interactions)
- Section 6.5: Functional viewpoint (data, management, communication functions)
- **Goal**: Familiarize yourself with standard terminology and the difference between viewpoints and domains

### Part 2: Multi-Viewpoint Analysis of a Real IoT System

Choose one of these IoT systems:
- Smart home (Nest, HomeKit, etc.)
- Wearable fitness tracker (Fitbit, Apple Watch)
- Industrial monitoring (factory sensors)
- Smart city (traffic lights, parking)

**Task A**: Create a diagram mapping components to the **six domains** (PED, SCD, ASD, OMD, UD, RAID).

**Task B**: Analyze the system from **three viewpoints**:

| Viewpoint | What to Document |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Foundational** | What is the system? What are its boundaries? What emergent characteristics does it have (autonomy, scalability, etc.)? |
| **Functional** | How do the six domains interact? Draw a data flow diagram showing how information moves through the system. |
| **Usage** | Who are the users? What are their roles? Describe one typical user workflow step-by-step. |

**Example (Fitbit System)**:

**Domains**:
```
PED: User's heart, steps, calories burned
SCD: Fitbit device (sensors: accelerometer, heart rate monitor; BLE radio)
ASD: Fitbit cloud (data processing, activity recognition, calorie calculation)
OMD: Firmware updates, device pairing, health data compliance (HIPAA)
UD: Fitbit mobile app (HMI)
RAID: OAuth login, API for third-party apps (MyFitnessPal, Strava)
```

**Viewpoint Analysis**:

*Foundational*: "The Fitbit system is a wearable health monitoring platform. Characteristics: (1) Autonomy - automatically detects activities without user input; (2) Shareability - data shared across multiple apps via API; (3) Accuracy - calibrated sensors for reliable health metrics."

*Functional*: "Data flow: PED (user's heartbeat) → SCD (heart rate sensor) → BLE → Mobile app (ASD local processing) → Cloud (ASD analytics) → UD (app displays heart rate graph). Commands flow reverse: UD (user sets alarm) → Cloud (ASD) → BLE → SCD (device vibrates)."

*Usage*: "Primary user role: Health-conscious individual. Workflow: (1) Morning: User checks sleep score on app (UD query to ASD); (2) During exercise: Device records heart rate (SCD to ASD); (3) Post-workout: User reviews workout summary, shares to social media (UD to RAID to external system)."

**Submission**: 1-2 pages with diagram + three viewpoint analyses (300-400 words total)

### Part 3: Set Up Development Environment
- Install ESP-IDF v5.1+
- Verify ESP32-C6 board detected
- Flash "hello world" example
- See [0_setup.md](0_setup.md) for instructions

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **ISO/IEC 30141** provides a common language for IoT architecture
2. ✅ **Six viewpoints** are lenses that answer different questions (Foundational, Business, Usage, Functional, Trustworthiness, Construction)
